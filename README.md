## 🧠 Key Projects

### 1. **[HUMAN BLACK BOX – AI-Powered Life Logger & Crash Recorder](https://github.com/jamezjk/HUMAN-BLACKBOX)**  
A wearable device that captures video, audio, and biometric data to detect accidents, medical emergencies, or attacks. It auto-saves the last 60 seconds and sends alerts to emergency contacts using AI-powered threat detection.

### 2. **[AI-Based Demand Prediction for Inventory Management](https://github.com/jamezjk/Invensense)**  
An AI model for predicting the demand of products in real-time, helping businesses minimize losses due to overstocking and optimize profit by recommending ideal prices for slow-moving products.

### 3. **[AI-Powered Fake News Detector](#)**  
Developed an open-source browser extension that detects fake news using AI models like RoBERTa. It provides real-time detection and enables users to report fake news with a Twitter Community Notes-like feedback mechanism.

### 4. **[Real-Time Stock Price Prediction and Visualization Using LSTM](https://github.com/jamezjk/cryptotracker)**  
Built a model using LSTM to predict stock prices in real-time. The project leverages **Matplotlib** for visualizing stock market trends and provides useful insights for investors.

### 5. **[AI Branch Manager – Video-Based Loan Assistance](https://github.com/jamezjk/loan-approval-api)**  
Developed a video-based loan assistance system that uses **face recognition** and **speech-to-text** technologies to assist users with loan applications.
